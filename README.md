# ðŸŒŸ Neural Network with Genetic Algorithm Training ðŸŒŸ
## This project focuses on training neural networks using a genetic algorithm approach.
> **Note**: Both the report and the video demonstration are available in Hebrew, as this project was a part of an assignment submitted in that language.

### ðŸ“š **Documentation**
_For a detailed explanation of the project, its architecture, and its features, please refer to our [**Report**](Report(Hebrew)/Identify_patterns_using_nn.pdf)
### ðŸŽ¥ **Demo**
_A video demonstration is available to help you understand how to run and utilize the program effectively. You can watch it [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X45aitACju0)._


### ðŸš€ **Quick Start**
_If you'd like to try out the program, an executable version is available for download from this [**Google Drive link**]([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IJQXZ8kennlluNSdHSD-fuaQ_BIYOo8H?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zjVoZISxNJmYD2GHkx-n5Hl-vtXxkLpH?usp=sharing))._
